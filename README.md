# VolumeRelay
Remap MacBook volume keys to be relayed to REST interface

# OK, but why?
Some Airplay, USB or TOSLINK devices do not support volume control (e.g. Pioneer N-50). When playing music to these devices, the volume keys are disabled. 

If your media setup supports controlling the volume via a REST call, this little tool will make you happy.

# Usage
Set the Name of the audio device which should activate the remapping of the volume keys and the corresponding URLs for volume up/down.

Then build and run...
